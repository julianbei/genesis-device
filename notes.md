## ✅ COMPLETED Water System Features

### 🏔️ **Geological Pipeline (Realistic Sequence)**
- **Step 1**: Generate base terrain (tectonic/volcanic formation)
- **Step 2**: Calculate river positions along terrain (flow accumulation)
- **Step 3**: Apply wind, thermal, and hydraulic erosion over time
- **Step 4**: Generate final water features based on eroded landscape

### 🌊 **Water & River System**
- **Flow Accumulation**: D8 algorithm calculates water flow patterns across terrain
- **River Generation**: Automatic river placement based on natural drainage patterns  
- **Realistic Erosion**: Multiple erosion types (wind, thermal, hydraulic) over geological time
- **Time-Based**: Erosion slider from 0-10,000 years affects landscape development
- **Sea Level Control**: Absolute sea level from -50m to +100m above base terrain
- **Beach Erosion**: Coastal areas get realistic gentle slopes and sandy transitions
- **Visual Water**: Semi-transparent water planes with proper UV mapping per tile
- **River Highlights**: Bright blue ribbons highlight river locations
- **Biome Integration**: Each biome (temperate, alpine, desert) has unique water parameters

### 🎛️ **Realistic Erosion Physics**
- **Wind Erosion**: Affects exposed ridges and high areas over time
- **Thermal Erosion**: Freeze-thaw cycles create rockfall and slope stability
- **Hydraulic Erosion**: Water-based erosion carves channels and transports sediment
- **Terrain-Adaptive Carving**: Rivers respond to terrain hardness
  - **Rocky Terrain**: Creates narrow, deep V-shaped canyons
  - **Medium Terrain**: Forms normal river channels  
  - **Soft Terrain**: Carves wide, shallow U-shaped river beds
- **Gradual Erosion**: No harsh cuts - rivers smoothly carve natural channels
- **Slope-Based Hardness**: Steep slopes = harder rock, gentle slopes = soft sediment
- **Multi-Pass Smoothing**: River banks and connections are naturally smoothed
- **Sediment Deposition**: Eroded material deposits downstream in appropriate locations
- **Climate Effects**: Alpine (freeze-thaw), Desert (wind), Temperate (rainfall) erosion patterns

### 🎮 **User Controls**
- **Show Water & Rivers**: Toggle to hide/show all water features
- **Biome Selection**: Different water characteristics per biome
  - 🌲 **Temperate**: Moderate rivers, medium beaches
  - 🏔️ **Alpine**: Fast mountain streams, minimal coastal areas  
  - 🏜️ **Desert**: Rare rivers, large dune-to-water transitions

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Rivers: run a simple flow-accumulation on the final height, paint a river mask, then subtract a narrow carved channel. Scatter water quads along that mask.

Performance: move filters to compute shaders (WebGPU) or fragment passes writing to float textures. Keep the CPU path as fallback.

Replace the solid-color defaults in TriplanarPBR with real tileable textures for best results.

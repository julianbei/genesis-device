## ✅ COMPLETED Water System Features

### 🌊 **Water & River System**
- **Flow Accumulation**: D8 algorithm calculates water flow patterns across terrain
- **River Generation**: Automatic river placement based on natural drainage patterns  
- **River Carving**: Rivers erode channels into the terrain with realistic depth profiles
- **Sea Level**: Configurable water level with areas below zero becoming ocean/lakes
- **Beach Erosion**: Coastal areas get realistic gentle slopes and sandy transitions
- **Visual Water**: Semi-transparent water planes with proper UV mapping per tile
- **River Highlights**: Bright blue ribbons highlight river locations
- **Biome Integration**: Each biome (temperate, alpine, desert) has unique water parameters

### 🎛️ **Realistic Erosion Physics**
- **Terrain-Adaptive Carving**: Rivers respond to terrain hardness
  - **Rocky Terrain**: Creates narrow, deep V-shaped canyons
  - **Medium Terrain**: Forms normal river channels  
  - **Soft Terrain**: Carves wide, shallow U-shaped river beds
- **Gradual Erosion**: No harsh cuts - rivers smoothly carve natural channels
- **Slope-Based Hardness**: Steep slopes = harder rock, gentle slopes = soft sediment
- **Multi-Pass Smoothing**: River banks and connections are naturally smoothed
- **Coastal Erosion**: Beaches create gentle slopes, never eroding below 30% of original height
- **River Carving**: Flow accumulation determines river strength, stronger flows carve deeper
- **Drainage Networks**: Natural dendritic (tree-like) river patterns emerge from terrain
- **Multi-scale Effects**: Rivers form at appropriate scales based on terrain resolution

### 🎮 **User Controls**
- **Show Water & Rivers**: Toggle to hide/show all water features
- **Biome Selection**: Different water characteristics per biome
  - 🌲 **Temperate**: Moderate rivers, medium beaches
  - 🏔️ **Alpine**: Fast mountain streams, minimal coastal areas  
  - 🏜️ **Desert**: Rare rivers, large dune-to-water transitions

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Rivers: run a simple flow-accumulation on the final height, paint a river mask, then subtract a narrow carved channel. Scatter water quads along that mask.

Performance: move filters to compute shaders (WebGPU) or fragment passes writing to float textures. Keep the CPU path as fallback.

Replace the solid-color defaults in TriplanarPBR with real tileable textures for best results.
